    <h1>SexyTopo Guide</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SexyTopo is an app for surveying caves and underground spaces. It is designed to work with a DistoX or DistoX2 measuring tool which the surveyor uses to measure out survey legs. The app communicates with the DistoX wirelessly over Bluetooth and automatically creates a model of the cave from measurements made with the device.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
	<p>SexyTopo runs on Android devices (the newer/more powerful the better). For obvious reasons a water- and dust-proof device is recommended. It is possible to control SexyTopo with finger movements but it is designed for use with a stylus.</p>
	<p>The Android device needs to have bluetooth communication turned on and be paired with the DistoX before it can 

	<h2>Calibration</h2>
	<p>The DistoX device needs calibration before it can be used reliably. This is not just a theoretical requirement; without calibration, measurements can be significantly off. Calibration needs to be performed after XXXXXXXXXX</p>
	<p>Calibration is not yet implemented in SexyTopo. Calibration will need to be performed using another software package, such as PocketTopo.

	<h2>Surveying</h2>
	<p>Selection of survey points is a skill that is improved with practice.</p>
	<p>Legs are added to the survey at the <strong>active station</strong>. By default the active station is the newest station added to the survey. In typical use a surveyor will take a number of splays from the active station and then take </p>
	<p>To create a new station make three repeated readings

	<h2>Sketching</h2>
	<p>The sketch views (plan and extended elevation) can be accessed through buttons on the Action Bar at the top of the screen. These show a projection of the calculated survey on a canvas so that a sketch of the cave can be drawn on top.</p>
	<p>Several sketching tools are provided via a toolbar at the bottom of the screen:
