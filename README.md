The SexyTopo cave and underground surveying app for Android. Next-gen surveying with a sexy interface :)

This app is experimental software made available for free with no guarantee it is fit for anything in particular. I'm not responsible if it loses your data or leads you into some horrific adventure. Caving is a potentially dangerous activity etc. etc. - you know the score :)


# FAQ

## I'm interested in giving SexyTopo a go. What do I do?
You need an Android phone. The easiest way is to install SexyTopo via the Google Play app store. Just search for "SexyTopo" and click install. It's a very small download.

If you can't access Google Play for some reason (e.g. you're in China) then you should be able to get the APK from here: https://github.com/richsmith/sexytopo/tree/master/app/release

## What Android device is best to use with SexyTopo?
I'm interested in opinions about best options here, but a secondhand Galaxy Note (e.g. 3 or 4) seems to work pretty well. A stylus in particular makes surveying a lot better.

## I'm interested in the SexyTopo project; can I help?
Great! Please get in touch. I'm interested in programmers, testers, ideas, etc.! There's also a Facebook group for updates about SexyTopo.

## I've had this problem...
If you get a crash (hopefully rare now), please make sure you connect your device to WiFi when you get a chance. A very basic error report will get uploaded if SexyTopo gets a chance (please also select "Send Error Report" for best results). A bug report email with more details is also super-useful.
